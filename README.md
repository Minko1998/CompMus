This repository is used as the base of Mink Spronk's research for the course Computational Musicology. In 2015 during the recording of his album 'Skeleton Trees' Nick Cave's son died due to a fall from a high cliff. Since this event there is even more room for sorrow and tragedy in Nick Cave's music. Since then he has also changed the way his permormances are held. These days Nick Cave talks to his audience as well as makes music for them. 
For this research Mink wants to examine which elements have changed in the music of Nick Cave since this event. Ghosteen is an album that is entirely geared towards the changes in his life that he's felt since this event.
